# SimpleTranslator

My first Qt project, simple translator, can only translate from russian to english

## Prerequisites

To use SimpleTranslator, you need to have Google Translation API key (you'll need to insert it in mainwindow.h)

### How to get Google Translation API

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/google/maps-apis/overview?supportedpurview=project).
2. Click the project drop-down and select or create the project for which you want to add an API key.
3. Click the menu button and select **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
4. On the **Credentials** page, click **Create credentials > API key**.<br/>
   The **API key created** dialog displays your newly created API key.
5. Click **Close**.<br/>
   The new API key is listed on the **Credentials** page under **API keys**.<br/>
   (Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)
